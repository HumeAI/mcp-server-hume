# Voice Design in Conversational AI

The quality and character of synthesized speech is determined by TWO equally important factors: the voice description AND the text being spoken. A voice description alone cannot create the desired effect if the text doesn't align with that voice's character. Likewise, expressive text needs an appropriate voice description to achieve the intended delivery.

When designing voices for characters, ALWAYS create custom sample text specifically for voice design purposes. This text should exemplify the character's manner of speaking, even if it doesn't appear in the final source material you'll eventually convert. Creating character-specific sample dialogue helps establish the voice's characteristics before applying it to the actual content. For example, a gruff detective character might need sample text like "I've been walking these streets for twenty years, kid. Nothing surprises me anymore" to properly capture their voice, even if those lines never appear in your script.

Focus on creating voice descriptions that capture both personality and speaking style. Effective voice designs should include details about the character's age, speaking tempo, emotional range, accent, and distinctive vocal qualities. The TTS system will interpret these descriptions alongside the actual text content to generate appropriate speech patterns.

The text content itself significantly shapes how the voice sounds. For example, pairing a voice description about a "calm, reflective elderly woman reminiscing about her childhood" with text like "The sun dipped below the horizon, casting golden hues over the fields of my youth" creates a harmonious effect. Conversely, using the same voice with text like "Let's get ready to rumble!" creates cognitive dissonance, as the text contradicts the character's established speech patterns.

Develop detailed character descriptions for voices. For example: "The speaker is Jimmy Sparks, a charismatic game show host with booming energy, infectious enthusiasm, and flawless, rapid-fire delivery during the show" or "The speaker is a bubbly influencer with a confident, charismatic voice that sparkles with energy, effortlessly blending warmth and excitement." You can also incorporate emotional states: "The speaker is ecstatic, celebrating a major victory" or "The character speaks with a mix of fear and anger."

Experiment with punctuation to guide emphasis and delivery. Plain text includes periods, commas, long dashes, exclamation marks, or question marks. Try capitalizing an entire word for stronger emphasis. However, avoid extra formatting or unusual symbols, as they can confuse the model. Emojis, HTML tags, markdown text, or uncommon symbols should be left out as they can lead to unpredictable generations.
