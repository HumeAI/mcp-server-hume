Silent stars above,
Whispering ancient secrets,
Night sky's lullaby.

Mountain peaks reaching,
Touching clouds with silent grace,
Nature's monuments.

Cherry blossoms fall,
Dancing in the gentle breeze,
Spring's fleeting beauty.

Ocean waves rolling,
Endless rhythm of the sea,
Time's patient journey.
